# Python-Practicum


### Project 1: Exploring US Flights
In this assignment, you will investigate the Airline On-Time Performance Data that we have already met in one of our lectures.
You will use the 2017 data available at 
https://auebgr-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/louridas_aueb_gr/EbeTzde1LddFmqNWBFWWxNcBj5tDR_zvzDHvqqcmnndeEQ?e=Tb1orW.

### Project 2: Kaggle Competition (top 17%)
In this assignment, you will participate in a Kaggle competition (although not one for which you can claim prizes).
The competition you will enter is House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques.

### Project 3: Spurious Correlations

##### Per Capita Cheese Consumption and Deaths by Accidential Suffocation and Strangulation in Bed
Show that, in the U.S., the per capita cheese consumption is correlated with the number of deaths by accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed. You must provide a figure, showing the situation, and the statistical results you find.

For the per capita cheese consumption you can use the data provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture at https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48685/pcconsp_1_.xlsx?v=42983.

For the deaths by accidental suffocation and strangulation you can use the data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html.
Note that you will have to search a bit to find what to put in the form to find the data on deaths by accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed; this could be half the fun, so you should do it alone.

##### Doctorates and Mozarella
Show that, in the U.S., the number of doctorates awarded in Biological and Biomedical Sciences is correlated with the per capita consumption of mozarella cheese. You must provide a figure, showing the situation, and the statistical results you find.

For the number of doctorates awarded, you can use the data provided by the National Science Foundation from the Survey of Earned Doctorates at https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/ids/sed.

For the mozarella consumption you can use the data provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture at https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48685/cheese_per_cap.xlsx?v=43006.
